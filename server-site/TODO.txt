ok some things to do

//alright because the way things work with mysql you might get an error when you first try to 
//connect to the server, so follow these steps

1. make sure you put your password for the database connection in the app.js page on this line
var dbConnectionPool = mysql.createPool({ host: 'localhost', user: 'root', password: 'YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE',database: 'wdc_hotel_website_data'});

2.if you get an error "...does not support this auth protocol" use this line in your database
  I'm not sure if you need to but you may need to go into the mysql database => USE mysql

  ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password'


//you should be able to connect after that, for now ive stuck in some placeholder values for users etc
